## PCB
using 
 - https://github.com/ebastler/marbastlib for choc and controller (0xCB helios) footprints

for whatever reason, the GC9A01 board that i've designed this around uses i2c names instead of spi names, however it does indeed use spi. I've chosen to use the labels printed on the solder mask of the LCD as opposed to the correct SPI ones.
